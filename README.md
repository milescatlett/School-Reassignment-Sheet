# School-Reassignment-Sheet
The district requested a collection of spreadsheets that would generate a workflow for assigning students to different schools. The script moves and assigns actions for rows from sheet to sheet, as well as sending emails.

I worked on the creation of a digital system for managing school reassignment forms for the district. I created a Google Apps Script written in JavaScript that moves completed rows to various staff, from spreadsheet to spreadsheet. The script also includes a dialog box to avoid errors. 

Principals and data managers in the district utilize the script. I collaborated with the district digital teaching and learning specialist.
